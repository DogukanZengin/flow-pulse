1. Thematic Immersion
	•	Current Issue: The XP gain and level-up screens look like generic mobile RPG popups, breaking the underwater research vibe.
	•	Improvement: Replace plain boxes with full-screen underwater celebration scenes:
	•	A school of glowing fish swimming across when you complete a session.
	•	Coral blooming or bioluminescent jellyfish lighting up when leveling up.
	•	Use rarity-based particle effects already in Phase 2 (green, blue, purple, orange) ￼.

2. Narrative Integration
	•	Current Issue: “+114 XP” feels mechanical.
	•	Improvement: Frame XP and levels as research milestones:
	•	Instead of “+114 Research XP” → “Your team logged 114 new data samples at 8m depth.”
	•	Instead of “Level 3 Research Capability” → “Promoted: Certified Coral Analyst.”
	•	Tie career levels to actual marine biology titles (your log already has Intern → Research Assistant → Professor → Master Marine Biologist ￼).

⸻

3. Visual Celebration Layers
	•	Background Animation: A subtle depth animation (bubbles rising, water shimmer).
	•	Mid-Layer FX: Particle bursts (marine snow, glowing plankton).
	•	Foreground Highlight: Achievement animation (e.g., a coral bloom or research station badge lighting up).

These layered effects make the celebration feel alive instead of flat boxes.

⸻

4. Emotional Rewards
	•	Current Issue: No “wow” moment — users just tap Next.
	•	Improvement Ideas:
	•	Rare Discovery Popups: Show a newly discovered species swimming across the screen with its name and rarity.
	•	Coral Growth Tied to Level: On each promotion, a coral structure flourishes visually.
	•	Badge Animation: Certifications shimmer with water-light refractions.

⸻

5. UX Flow Refinement
	•	Merge the two-step dialogs (XP summary and career advancement) into one fluid animation:
	•	Start with session results → XP counts up dynamically → career badge “levels up” → background animation completes.
	•	Allow tapping to skip animation for speed.

⸻

6. Consistency with Phase 3 Graphics
	•	You’ve already built advanced creature rendering and biome-specific lighting ￼. Use them here:
	•	Legendary promotions could trigger “bioluminescent abyss glow” effects.
	•	Shallow level promotions could show coral reef bursts with tropical fish.
