## 2. First Expedition Tutorial (Hands-On)
**Goal:** Teach timer → depth → discovery link.  
**Flow:**

# 🔑 UX Principles for Onboarding
1. **Narrative over tutorial:** Make it feel like joining a research mission, not just learning controls.  
2. **Hands-on teaching:** Instead of long explanations, the first session *is* the tutorial.  
3. **Immediate payoff:** First discovery + first promotion within 10 minutes.  
4. **Curiosity gap:** Show locked species silhouettes to spark collecting drive.  
5. **Balance work & rest:** Introduce surface deck early so users value Pomodoro flow.

👉 This flow makes onboarding feel like *the first chapter of a story*, not just setup.
